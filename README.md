# OVERVIEW

This repository named TRESORNDALA._SportsPrediction is meant for predicting the overall score of football players based on 7 high importances features that were chosen having high correlation but not only that but also from the impact of per example prefered foot of a player even though not having high correlation with overall score when we calculated but as it is very important to determine the performance of a player as we know that a player playing at the left performance will be very different if put at the right ,we took it and enconded it and scaled it . to understand well i will give the link .

 ## Here is the link to the Video demonstrating how my web page works:

# Repository content

It contains the following files:
# TRESOR NDALA BUZANGU._SportsPrediction.ipynb 

A Google Colab notebook.

# TRESOR NDALA BUZANGU._SportsPrediction.py

The Python version of the Colab notebook.

# source_code_of_the_model_deployment.py 


The source code for the model deployment that helped us to deploy through stremlit.


# A youtube link to a video demonstrating how my web page works .
 # https://youtu.be/FypNmDWctS0

after doing my application deployment to streamlit i recorded this video to show how it works.
#Gradient.skl and scaler.skl 

after training my model i downloaded these two and they served me in my application to scale the inputs entered by the users scaler.skl and to predict the model gradient.skl
# requirements.txt 

i put it to help those who read this project to know some important required library to deploy my model as i did.

# Gradient.skl performance


# Gradient.skl performance for training data

# Goal of the application in the source_code_of_the_model_deployment.py

This application predicts the overall performance of a player based on specific characteristics selected from a rigorous process of understanding and correlating various factors that impact a player's performance which are 7 and explained in the video of the demonstraction.
